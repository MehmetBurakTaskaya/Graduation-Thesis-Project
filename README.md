## Title: Decoding Sequence Patterns and Conserved Motifs in Housekeeping Gene Upstream Regions: Unveiling Deeper Implications in Escherichia coli

### Abstract

This graduation thesis project explores sequence patterns and conserved motifs in the upstream regions of housekeeping genes. By comparing several housekeeping gene sequences within a dataset, we identify conserved areas and common motifs. Our analysis involves examining the nucleotide sequences of various housekeeping genes, including rpoB, recA, infB, gyrB, gapA, and dnaE, both individually and in a combined dataset. We apply our findings to 50 different gene sequences from Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 and compare them with previous outcomes to determine any differences and advancements.

The results of our analysis provide interesting insights into the sequence features and motif density in these regions. For instance, the upstream regions of the rpoB and recA genes exhibit higher concentrations of Guanine nucleotides, followed by a considerable concentration of Adenine nucleotides. In contrast, the gapA gene displays longer conserved areas with numerous spikes of each base. On the other hand, the upstream regions of the infB and gyrB genes exhibit larger quantities of guanine and adenine without any obvious shared characteristics. Furthermore, our study reveals the presence of Shine Dalgarno sequences and other widespread patterns in a significant number of sequences. The coherence of these findings is further supported by analyzing Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 sequences.

Overall, this analysis emphasizes the importance of gene regulation and offers opportunities for further experimental investigations. By delivering valuable insights into the sequence properties and potential motifs in the upstream regions of housekeeping genes, this study lays the foundation for future investigations into the functional significance of these sequence properties.
